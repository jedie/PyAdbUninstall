== notes

You can't just install all listed apps. Some of them are essential system app and deinstall will brick or damages the OS!

There are two modes:

 * {{{uninstall apps}}} - Will deinstall the package for the current user
 * {{{deactivate apps}}} - Will only deactivate the package for the current user

It's safer to just deactivate the apps ;)


=== uninstall / locked apps

There is a list of apk package names that are "locked" in PyAdbUninstall

But this list is incomplete!

The list is {{{LOCKED_APPS}}} in:

 * [[https://github.com/jedie/PyAdbUninstall/blob/master/adb_uninstall/constants.py|adb_uninstall/constants.py]]

Please help to complete this list by github pull request ;)


== package actions by hand via adb

Check / init adb connection:
{{{
# Just show version information:
$ adb version
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.36
Revision 1:7.0.0+r33-2

# List of devices attached:
$ adb devices -l

# kill the adb server if it is running:
$ adb kill-server

# Kick current connection from host side and make it reconnect:
$ adb reconnect
}}}


List all installed apk packages:

{{{
$ adb shell pm list packages
}}}


Deactivate one apk package:

{{{
$ adb shell pm disable-user <packagname>
}}}


Uninstall one apk package:

{{{
$ pm uninstall -k --user 0 <packagname>
}}}

* {{{-k}}} - keep the data and cache directories
* {{{--user 0}}} - Deinstall only for current user


== dev. startup

{{{
# clone repository from github:
~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/PyAdbUninstall.git

# create virtualenv
~$ cd PyAdbUninstall
~/PyAdbUninstall$ ./create_env.sh

# activate virtualenv
~/PyAdbUninstall$ source bin/activate

# Start GUI:
(.virtualenv) ~/PyAdbUninstall$ adb_uninstall
}}}



== help wanted
